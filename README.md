# Bridge

**Bridge** is a lightweight, native HTTP client built in **Rust** using the **gpui** framework — the same tech stack that powers [Zed](https://zed.dev). It’s designed for developers who want the speed of a terminal and the comfort of a native UI.

Bridge helps you send, inspect, and organize HTTP requests without the bulk of traditional tools. It’s fast, minimal, and built for the keyboard.

### ✦ Key features

* **Native performance** — Rust + gpui deliver instant startup and smooth interactions.
* **Minimal design** — Focus on your requests, not the tool around them.
* **Request workspace** — Organize endpoints, headers, and payloads with ease.
* **Developer-centric** — Keyboard-first navigation, JSON highlighting, and raw response views.
* **Open and hackable** — Simple architecture for custom extensions or scripts.

### ✦ Philosophy

Bridge doesn’t try to be an API management platform. It’s a sharp, fast instrument for making requests and seeing results — built for developers who live in text editors and terminals.
